		Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home, because it's not my home, it's their home, and I'm welcome no more. And if a double-decker bus, crashes into us, to die by your side, is such a heavenly way to die, and if a ten-ton truck, kills the both of us, to die by your side, well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine.<br><br>

		Take me out tonight, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, and in the darkened underpass, I thought oh God, my chance has come at last, (but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask.) Take me out tonight, oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, driving in your car, I never never want to go home, because I haven't got one, da, oh, I haven't got one.<br><br>

With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine, they were born and then they lived and then they died, seems so unfair, I want to cry.<br><br>

		You say, "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn," And you claim these words as your own, but I've read well and I've heard them said, a hundred times, maybe less, maybe more. If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own, don't plagiarize or take on loan, 'cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows, and who trips you up and laughs when you fall, who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall. You say, "'Ere long done do does did," Words which could only be your own, and then produce the text from whence was ripped, some dizzy whore, 1804.<br><br>

But as always, I couldn't get myself to just copy the design provided, and did a bit of customization.
