Oh, but don't mention love, I'd hate the strain of the pain again, a rush and a push and the land that, we stand on is ours. It has been before, so it shall be again, and people who are uglier than you and I, they take what they need, and just leave.

		Oh, but don't mention love, I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again, a rush and a push and the land that, we stand on is ours, it has been before, so why can't it be now? And people who are weaker than you or I, they take what they want from life. Oh, but don't mention love, no - no, don't mention love! `,

		content: `I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour, but heaven knows I'm miserable now, I was looking for a job, and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now. In my life, why do I give valuable time, to people who don't care if I live or die.

		Two lovers entwined pass me by, and heaven knows I'm miserable now, I was looking for a job, and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now. In my life, why do I give valuable time, to people who don't care if I live or die, what she asked of me at the end of the day. Caligula would have blushed, "You've been the house too long" she said, and I naturally fled.`,

		And is it really so strange? Oh, is it really so strange? Oh, is it really so, really so strange? I say NO, you say YES, (and you will change your mind.) I left the South, I travelled North, I got confused - I killed a horse, I can't help the way I feel. Oh yes, you can punch me, and you can butt me, and you can break my spine, but you won't change the way I feel, 'cause I love you, oh...`,

I would go out tonight, but I haven't got a stitch to wear, this man said, "It's gruesome, that someone so handsome should care." Ah, a jumped-up country boy, who never knew his place, he said, "Return the ring," He knows so much about these things, he knows so much about these things.`,

This is the last night of the fair, and the grease in the hair, of a speedway operator, is all a tremulous heart requires, a schoolgirl is denied, she said: "How quickly would I die, oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
