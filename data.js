		content: `They said: "There's too much caffeine, in your bloodstream, and a lack of real spice, in your life." I said: "Leave me alone, because I'm alright, dad, surprised to still be on my own..." Oh, but don't mention love, I'd hate the strain of the pain again, a rush and a push and the land that, we stand on is ours. It has been before, so it shall be again, and people who are uglier than you and I, they take what they need, and just leave.

		Oh, but don't mention love, I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again, a rush and a push and the land that, we stand on is ours, it has been before, so why can't it be now? And people who are weaker than you or I, they take what they want from life. Oh, but don't mention love, no - no, don't mention love! `,

		content: `I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour, but heaven knows I'm miserable now, I was looking for a job, and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now. In my life, why do I give valuable time, to people who don't care if I live or die.

		Two lovers entwined pass me by, and heaven knows I'm miserable now, I was looking for a job, and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now. In my life, why do I give valuable time, to people who don't care if I live or die, what she asked of me at the end of the day. Caligula would have blushed, "You've been the house too long" she said, and I naturally fled.`,

		Gasping - but somehow still alive, this is the fierce last stand of all I am. Gasping - dying - but somehow still alive, this is the final stand of all I am, please keep me in mind.`,

		And is it really so strange? Oh, is it really so strange? Oh, is it really so, really so strange? I say NO, you say YES, (and you will change your mind.) I left the South, I travelled North, I got confused - I killed a horse, I can't help the way I feel. Oh yes, you can punch me, and you can butt me, and you can break my spine, but you won't change the way I feel, 'cause I love you, oh...`,

		content: `All men have secrets and here is mine, so let it be known, for we have been through hell and high tide, I think I can rely on you... And yet you start to recoil, heavy words are so lightly thrown, but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you. So, what difference does it make? So, what difference does it make? It makes none, but now you have gone, and you must be looking very old tonight.

		Oh, what difference does it make? Oh, it makes none, but now you have gone, and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight. Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do, I stole, and then I lied, just because you asked me to, but now you know the truth about me, you won't see me anymore, well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh.`,

		Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package! Re-evaluate the songs, double-pack with a photograph, extra track (and a tacky badge.) A-list, playlist, "Please them, please them!" "Please them!" (sadly, this was your life.) But you could have said no, if you'd wanted to, you could have said no, if you'd wanted to.

		BPI, MTV, BBC, "Please them! Please then!" (sadly this was your life.) But you could have said no, if you'd wanted to, you could have walked away, ... Couldn't you?

		I touched you at the soundcheck, you had no real way of knowing, in my heart I begged "Take me with you... I don't care where you're going..." But to you I was faceless, I was fawning, I was boring, just a child from those ugly new houses, who could never begin to know. Who could never really know, oh...`,

Loved and lost, and some may say, "When usually it's nothing, surely you're happy, it should be this way!" I say: "No, I'm gonna kill my dog," And: "May the lines sag, may the lines sag, heavy and deep tonight."

		I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday, I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday, 'cause you're evil, and you lie, and if you should die, I may feel slightly sad, (but I won't cry.) Loved and lost, and some may say: "When usually it's nothing, surely you're happy, it should be this way!" I said "No," And then I shot myself, so, drink, drink, drink, and be ill tonight. From the one you left behind, from the one you left behind, from the one you left behind, from the one you left behind.`,

I would go out tonight, but I haven't got a stitch to wear, this man said, "It's gruesome, that someone so handsome should care." Ah, a jumped-up country boy, who never knew his place, he said, "Return the ring," He knows so much about these things, he knows so much about these things.`,
